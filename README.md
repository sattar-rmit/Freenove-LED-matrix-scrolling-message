Freenove LED matrix scrolling message; Given is the code that uses Freenove projects kit. 
However, if you follow the circuitry built around shift register IC 74HC595 to save the pins on Arduino, this code is for you! 
Even if you do not use the shift register ICs, this code is still for you; 
You only need to figure out the row/col connections of the LED matrix display that you are using and the pin numbers on Arduino.
